    <p>
      The purpose of this page is to show what I can create using HTML in a
      basic web page, and to talk about my high school:

      <li>
        We are located on the North side of St. Charles, and our rival is on the
        other side of the Fox River
      </li>
    </ul>
    <em>This semester lays out something like this...</em>
